The left side of the page shows **Virgin Voyages Embarkation Stats**.

<center><img src="/img/embarkation_stats.png"></center>   <center>Figure 13: Embarkation Stats</center>

These stats display the number of sailors sailing on the next voyage for each ship. Additionally, it shows what percentage of each ship’s sailors is Ready to Sail (RTS) and what percentage is Moderate Online Check-In (MOCI)ed.  

??? note "Note"
    There is a recommendation to increase the percentage of ship’s sailors that are [MOCIed](/sre_manual/global_glossary/#moci "Moderate Online Check-In"), as that would [allay](/sre_manual/global_glossary/#allay "to reduce in severity") the burden on Embarkation Ports.  

Towards the middle of the page are three tables, as follows:

* ***Synchronization***- It displays the synchronization status for different data that is being synced on the Shore side. 

* ***Sailor Manifest***- This table shows the total number of embarking sailors across the three repositories namely Seaware,[VXP](/sre_manual/global_glossary/#vxp "Virgin eXperience Platform"), and [MXP](/sre_manual/global_glossary/#mxp "Marine Exchange Platform"). 

* ***Data comparison***- This section of the Dashboard will display the comparison of data counts for Visitors, Dining, [ARS](/sre_manual/global_glossary/#ars "Activity Reservation System"), and Multimedia, for the next 2 voyages.
