<u>Improvement-Shore Dashboard</u>

<u>Data Comparison</u>

To address any mismatch in sailor counts, a new repository called "Seaware" has been added under two main components, namely Dining Shore & Shore Ex. in Data Comparison section. 
The reference data for the data comparisons within the components’ repositories would be Seaware since it is the [SOR](/sre_manual/global_glossary/#sor "System of Record").

<u>[MAS](/sre_manual/global_glossary/#mas "Mobile Assembly Suite")Counts</u>

An additional repository “MAS” has been added under two tables namely Guest Stats and Crew Stats. As the counts must ideally match between all the repos and MAS because of safety concerns so that no soul is missed out during safety drill / emergency evacuation.
