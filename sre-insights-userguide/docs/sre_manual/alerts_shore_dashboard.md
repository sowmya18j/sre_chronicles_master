Then on the right side, there is a section for Alerts.

Whenever there is a problem in production, an automatic ticket will be generated for the issue, which will be reflected on the right side in the Alerts section.

On the top of the ALERTS section, a user will find a “Last Updated” label, which indicates the time when the alert section was last refreshed. Then below it is the Alert Card. 

The alert card includes the following information-

* The **title** of the alert that is not working. 
* “View Ticket” option which will direct the user to the Jira ticket for the particular alert.
* Besides the “View Ticket” option, there displays the **age of the alert** i.e. the time when the ticket was generated against the alert.
* At the bottom of the alert card, it shows the length of time that the sync has been inoperative.

Whoa!! No Alerts.                                                                                                                                         
There is another situation where there are no alerts. 

Then, the “ALERTS” section shows this ![icon](../img/icon.png)icon, followed by the message “Great, No Alerts!”.

The user can also refresh the section by clicking the “Refresh” option present under the  “Great, No Alerts” message.
