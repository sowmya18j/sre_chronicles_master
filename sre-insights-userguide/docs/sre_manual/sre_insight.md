## Getting Started

SRE INSIGHTS is a proactive monitoring tool developed by the DeCurtis SRE Team. It is a strategic improvement aimed at reducing the production load. It also helps in monitoring the data sync between Shore and Ship and between the three repositories namely, [VXP](/sre_manual/global_glossary/#vxp "Virgin eXperience Platform") Core, [VXP](/sre_manual/global_glossary/#vxp "Virgin eXperience Platform") Couch, and Shipboard Property Management System (SPMS) i.e., [MXP](/sre_manual/global_glossary/#mxp "Marine Exchange Platform"). 

## Purpose of SRE Insights

This web application is used for the following purposes:

- To track the status of the ships in real-time. 
- To provide us with the itinerary of active and upcoming voyages.
- For tracking the discrepancy of the manifest counts. 
- To alert the user regarding the data sync failure occurring for Virgin Voyagesâ€™ three ships.
